# Machine Learning

## Epicodus Capstone Planning - December 7th, 2018

### By **Brian Nelson**

## Description

Web app will be a visual and data demostration of machine learning and genetic algorithms. A sample group of objects will perform tasks and then the populations will generate new populations to try to perform those same tasks or better. The goal is to have each generation perform better overall.

## Minimum Features

1. Fully functioning web app with a landing page with about information.
2. Data display route
3. Visual display of populations utilizing p5
4. Number display of populations
5. Use at least one machine learning techniques, or genetic algorithms, or nueral networks

## Minimum Technologies

* React
* P5
* JavaScript
* Node.js

## Wishlist Features
1. Have an example using a concept from each area: 
* Machine Learning
* Genetic Algorithm
* Nueral Network
2. Utilize js library to perform larger and differenct computations
3. Add user interaction forms and controls
4. Run multiple testing windows at the same time to display differences.

## Wishlist Technologies
* TensorFlow.js

## Development Notes & Issues

## Additional Thoughts

A lot of the work will be researching and learning how many of these concepts are done and coded. There are many out of the box libraries that can do these sort of things for me already, but I would like to learn some of the basics before moving into using a library.
